#### User Story 3.2: Task Creation and Configuration
**As a Healthcare Provider, I want to create custom tasks with specific instructions and completion criteria so that patients understand exactly what they need to do.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am creating a new task in the protocol builder
- When I configure the task details
- Then I should be able to set the task type (exercise, assessment, education, medication)
- And I should be able to add detailed instructions with rich text formatting
- And I should be able to attach videos, images, or documents
- And I should be able to set completion criteria and validation rules
- And I should be able to configure voice response options
- And I should be able to set task dependencies and prerequisites
- And I should be able to specify provider notification triggers

**Technical Implementation:**
- Rich text editor with medical terminology support
- Media upload and management system
- Completion criteria configuration interface
- Voice response pattern matching
- Task dependency graph visualization

**Task Configuration Interface:**
```typescript
<TaskConfiguration
  taskType={selectedTaskType}
  onInstructionsChange={handleInstructionsChange}
  onMediaUpload={handleMediaUpload}
  onCompletionCriteriaSet={handleCompletionCriteria}
  enableVoiceResponse={true}
  showDependencyGraph={true}
/>
```

#### User Story 3.3: Conditional Logic and Branching
**As a Healthcare Provider, I want to create conditional task flows so that patients receive personalized care based on their responses and progress.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am building a recovery protocol
- When I add conditional logic to tasks or assessments
- Then I should be able to create if-then rules based on patient responses
- And I should be able to branch protocols based on pain levels or complications
- And I should be able to set automatic task modifications based on performance
- And I should be able to create escalation triggers for concerning responses
- And I should be able to test the conditional logic before deployment
- And the system should handle complex multi-condition scenarios

**Technical Implementation:**
- Visual rule builder with condition chaining
- Response-based protocol branching
- Automatic task difficulty adjustment algorithms
- Provider alert trigger configuration
- Logic testing and simulation tools

**Conditional Logic Builder:**
```typescript
<ConditionalLogicBuilder
  availableConditions={conditionTypes}
  availableActions={actionTypes}
  onRuleCreate={handleRuleCreate}
  onRuleTest={handleRuleTest}
  enableComplexConditions={true}
  showFlowVisualization={true}
/>
```

### Epic: Assessment Form Creation

**As a Healthcare Provider, I want to create comprehensive assessment forms that integrate seamlessly with the chat interface so that patient data collection feels natural and complete.**

#### User Story 3.4: Medical Questionnaire Builder
**As a Healthcare Provider, I want to build custom medical questionnaires with validation and conditional questions so that I collect accurate, complete patient information.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am creating a new medical questionnaire
- When I use the form builder interface
- Then I should be able to add various question types (text, multiple choice, scale, date)
- And I should be able to set validation rules for each field
- And I should be able to create conditional questions that appear based on previous answers
- And I should be able to add medical terminology and explanations
- And I should be able to configure voice input options for each question
- And I should be able to set required vs optional fields
- And I should be able to preview the form in chat interface format

**Technical Implementation:**
- Drag-and-drop form builder with medical field types
- Advanced validation rule engine
- Conditional question logic system
- Medical terminology integration
- Chat interface preview mode

**Form Builder Interface:**
```typescript
<MedicalFormBuilder
  fieldTypes={medicalFieldTypes}
  validationRules={validationOptions}
  onFieldAdd={handleFieldAdd}
  onConditionalLogicAdd={handleConditionalLogic}
  enableVoiceInput={true}
  previewMode="chat"
/>
