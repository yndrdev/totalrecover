# ACTIVITY.MD FILE FIX

## ðŸ”§ QUICK FIX FOR MISSING docs/activity.md

The error occurs because the `docs/activity.md` file doesn't exist yet in your fresh project.

### **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

#### **Option 1: Create the file manually (30 seconds)**
```bash
# In your project root directory:
mkdir docs
touch docs/activity.md
echo "# TJV Recovery Platform - Development Activity Log" > docs/activity.md
echo "" >> docs/activity.md
echo "## Project Setup" >> docs/activity.md
echo "- Fresh Next.js project created" >> docs/activity.md
echo "- PROMPT 1: Supabase connection completed" >> docs/activity.md
echo "- PROMPT 2: Patient chat interface in progress" >> docs/activity.md
```

#### **Option 2: Give Roo Code this quick prompt**
```
CREATE MISSING DOCS DIRECTORY AND ACTIVITY FILE

Task: Create the missing docs/activity.md file that the system is looking for

Requirements:
1. Create docs/ directory in project root
2. Create docs/activity.md file
3. Add initial content:
   - Project title
   - Setup completion notes
   - Ready for activity logging

This will resolve the "File not found" error and allow the system to track activities properly.
```

### **WHY THIS HAPPENED:**
- Fresh project doesn't have docs/ directory
- Prompts include instruction to log to docs/activity.md
- System tries to append but file doesn't exist
- Simple directory/file creation fixes it

### **AFTER FIXING:**
- Continue with PROMPT 2 completion
- System will log activities properly
- No more file not found errors

### **ALTERNATIVE (Skip Activity Logging):**
If you want to skip the activity logging for now, you can remove this line from future prompts:
```
"Every time you perform actions related to the project, append your actions to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you."
```

But it's better to create the file - it helps track what's been built!
