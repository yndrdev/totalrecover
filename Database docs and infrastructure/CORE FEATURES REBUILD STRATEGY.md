# CORE FEATURES REBUILD STRATEGY

## SITUATION ASSESSMENT & REBUILD PLAN

The TJV Recovery platform is deployed but core features (chat, forms, authentication) are broken or misaligned. Need systematic rebuild approach.

---

## ROO CODE vs CLAUDE CODE DECISION

### **üéØ RECOMMENDATION: Use ROO CODE for This Rebuild**

#### **Why Roo Code is Better for This Situation:**
- **Codebase Indexing**: Can understand the entire project structure and existing code
- **Systematic Approach**: Better for large-scale feature rebuilds
- **Context Awareness**: Understands relationships between components
- **Architectural Understanding**: Can see how features should connect
- **Consistent Implementation**: Maintains patterns across the rebuild

#### **When to Use Claude Code:**
- **Specific Bug Fixes**: Individual syntax errors or small issues
- **Targeted Problems**: Single component fixes
- **Quick Debugging**: Isolated problem solving

#### **For This Rebuild: Roo Code is the Right Choice**
- **Large Scope**: Multiple interconnected features need rebuilding
- **Architectural Work**: Need to understand and fix system relationships
- **Consistency**: Ensure all features work together properly
- **Healthcare Standards**: Maintain HIPAA compliance and security throughout

## CRITICAL ISSUES ASSESSMENT

### **üö® Priority 1: Authentication (Can't Log In)**
```
AUTHENTICATION REBUILD PRIORITY

ISSUE: Cannot log in to deployed application
IMPACT: Complete system inaccessible
URGENCY: Critical - blocks all testing and usage

LIKELY CAUSES:
- Supabase authentication configuration broken
- Environment variables missing or incorrect
- Auth routes not working properly
- Session management broken
- Redirect URLs misconfigured

REBUILD APPROACH:
1. Verify Supabase connection and configuration
2. Rebuild authentication components from scratch
3. Test login/logout flow thoroughly
4. Ensure proper session management
5. Verify all auth routes work correctly
```

### **üîß Priority 2: Chat Interface (Core Feature)**
```
CHAT INTERFACE REBUILD PRIORITY

ISSUE: Chat features mixed up or not working
IMPACT: Core patient experience broken
URGENCY: High - essential for platform functionality

LIKELY CAUSES:
- Chat components not following conversational design
