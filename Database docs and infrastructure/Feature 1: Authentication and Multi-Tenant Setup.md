# Feature 1: Authentication and Multi-Tenant Setup

## Overview

The authentication and multi-tenant setup feature forms the foundation of the TJV Smart Recovery App, providing secure access control and data isolation for multiple healthcare practices. This feature implements a comprehensive role-based access control system with HIPAA-compliant security measures, supporting six distinct user roles across a multi-tenant SaaS architecture.

## User Stories

### Epic: Multi-Tenant Authentication System

**As a SaaS Owner, I want to manage multiple healthcare practices on a single platform so that I can scale the business efficiently while maintaining data isolation.**

#### User Story 1.1: Tenant Registration and Setup
**As a SaaS Owner, I want to onboard new healthcare practices with their own isolated environment so that each practice has secure access to their patient data.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am a SaaS Owner with administrative privileges
- When I create a new tenant account for a healthcare practice
- Then the system should generate a unique subdomain (e.g., `drsmith.tjvrecovery.com`)
- And create an isolated data environment with proper RLS policies
- And send welcome credentials to the practice administrator
- And initialize default recovery protocols and notification rules
- And set up the practice's branding configuration
- And configure the subscription tier and feature access

**Technical Implementation:**
- Create tenant record in `tenants` table with unique subdomain
- Initialize tenant-specific data using `seed_tenant_data()` function
- Set up Supabase RLS policies for data isolation
- Configure subdomain routing in Next.js middleware
- Send welcome email with setup instructions

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema Integration

The authentication system integrates with the following database tables:

**Core Tables:**
- `tenants` - Practice/organization information and configuration
- `profiles` - Extended user profiles with role and tenant association
- `user_sessions` - Session tracking and device management
- `role_permissions` - Dynamic role-based permission configuration
- `audit_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail for all authentication events

**Key Relationships:**
- Each user profile belongs to exactly one tenant
- Users can have multiple active sessions across devices
- All authentication events are logged for compliance
- Role permissions are configurable per tenant

```

### Security Implementation

#### Row Level Security Policies

```sql
-- Tenant isolation policy
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation" ON profiles
  FOR ALL USING (tenant_id = get_current_tenant_id());

-- Role-based access policy
CREATE POLICY "role_based_access" ON patients
  FOR ALL USING (
    tenant_id = get_current_tenant_id() AND
    (
      get_current_user_role() IN ('saas_owner', 'practice_admin') OR
      (get_current_user_role() = 'surgeon' AND assigned_surgeon = get_current_user_id()) OR
      (get_current_user_role() = 'nurse' AND assigned_nurse = get_current_user_id()) OR
      (get_current_user_role() = 'physical_therapist' AND assigned_pt = get_current_user_id()) OR
      (get_current_user_role() = 'patient' AND user_id = get_current_user_id())
    )
  );
```

#### Middleware Implementation

```typescript
// Next.js middleware for tenant routing and authentication
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;
  const hostname = request.headers.get('host') || '';
  
  // Extract subdomain
  const subdomain = hostname.split('.')[0];
  
  // Handle tenant routing
  if (subdomain && subdomain !== 'www' && subdomain !== 'app') {
    // Validate tenant exists
    const tenant = await validateTenant(subdomain);
    if (!tenant) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/tenant-not-found', request.url));
    }
    
    // Set tenant context
    const response = NextResponse.next();
    response.headers.set('x-tenant-id', tenant.id);
    return response;
  }
  
  // Handle authentication
  const token = request.cookies.get('auth-token')?.value;
  if (!token && pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### Integration Points

#### Supabase Auth Integration

```typescript
// Supabase client configuration
const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    persistSession: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true
  }
});

// Custom auth hooks
export function useAuth() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [tenant, setTenant] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Get initial session
    supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => {
      setUser(session?.user ?? null);
      if (session?.user) {
        loadUserProfile(session.user.id);
      }
      setLoading(false);
    });
    
    // Listen for auth changes
    const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
      async (event, session) => {
        setUser(session?.user ?? null);
        if (session?.user) {
          await loadUserProfile(session.user.id);
        } else {
          setTenant(null);
        }
        setLoading(false);
      }
    );
    
    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, []);
  
  return { user, tenant, loading };
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```typescript
// Authentication service tests
describe('AuthService', () => {
  test('should register new user with valid data', async () => {
    const userData = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'SecurePass123!',
      role: 'surgeon',
      tenantId: 'tenant-123'
    };
    
    const result = await AuthService.register(userData);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.user.email).toBe(userData.email);
  });
  
  test('should enforce role-based permissions', async () => {
    const nurseUser = { role: 'nurse', tenantId: 'tenant-123' };
    const patientData = { id: 'patient-456', tenantId: 'tenant-123' };
    
    const canDelete = await PermissionService.canDelete(nurseUser, 'patient', patientData);
    expect(canDelete).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```typescript
// Multi-tenant isolation tests
describe('Multi-tenant Isolation', () => {
  test('should prevent cross-tenant data access', async () => {
    const tenant1User = await createTestUser({ tenantId: 'tenant-1' });
    const tenant2Patient = await createTestPatient({ tenantId: 'tenant-2' });
    
    const response = await request(app)
      .get(`/api/patients/${tenant2Patient.id}`)
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${tenant1User.token}`)
      .expect(403);
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests

```typescript
// User registration flow
test('complete user registration and onboarding', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to registration page
  await page.goto('/register?token=invitation-token-123');
  
  // Fill registration form
  await page.fill('[data-testid=email]', 'surgeon@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid=password]', 'SecurePass123!');
  await page.fill('[data-testid=license-number]', 'MD123456');
  
  // Submit form
  await page.click('[data-testid=submit-registration]');
  
  // Verify redirect to onboarding
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/onboarding');
  
  // Complete profile setup
  await page.fill('[data-testid=first-name]', 'Dr. John');
  await page.fill('[data-testid=last-name]', 'Smith');
  await page.selectOption('[data-testid=specialty]', 'Orthopedic Surgery');
  
  // Upload profile photo
  await page.setInputFiles('[data-testid=profile-photo]', 'test-photo.jpg');
  
  // Complete onboarding
  await page.click('[data-testid=complete-onboarding]');
  
  // Verify redirect to dashboard
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
});
```

```

### Performance Optimization

- Implement Redis caching for session data and tenant configurations
- Use CDN for static assets and tenant branding files
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing on tenant_id and user_id
- Implement connection pooling for database connections
- Use lazy loading for user profile data and permissions

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up authentication failure rate monitoring
- Monitor session duration and concurrent user limits
- Track tenant usage metrics for billing purposes
- Alert on suspicious login patterns or potential security breaches
- Monitor API response times for authentication endpoints

This comprehensive authentication and multi-tenant setup provides the secure foundation needed for the TJV Smart Recovery App while ensuring HIPAA compliance and scalable multi-tenant architecture.
