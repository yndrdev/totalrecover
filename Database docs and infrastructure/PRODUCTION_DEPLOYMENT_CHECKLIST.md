## Rollback Plan

### üö® Emergency Rollback Procedures

#### Quick Rollback to Demo Mode
If critical issues arise, quickly disable security features:

1. **Disable RLS (Database)**
   ```sql
   -- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
   ALTER TABLE tenants DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE patients DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE providers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE conversations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE messages DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Disable Email Confirmation (Code)**
   - Remove `emailRedirectTo` from signup route
   - Restore immediate profile creation
   - Update success message
   - Deploy emergency fix

3. **Supabase Dashboard**
   - Disable email confirmations in auth settings
   - Verify changes take effect immediately

#### Full Rollback to Previous Version
- [ ] Deploy previous stable version
- [ ] Restore database from backup if needed
- [ ] Verify all functionality restored
- [ ] Communicate status to stakeholders
