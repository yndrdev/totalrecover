Procedure: _________________________     Diagnosis: _____________________
Physician: _________________________

A. I have been scheduled for the surgical or diagnostic procedure shown in my surgical or procedural informed consent form for which anesthesia services are available. Dr. ________________________________ is the anesthesiologist providing care.

B. I agree that solely as to anesthesia services attendant to this procedure, and post-operative pain management, the information listed below has been fully explained to me in terms I understand through the use of videotapes, audiotapes, pamphlets, booklets, or other means of communication or through conversations with the responsible physician, or other medical personnel under the supervision and control of the responsible physician, other medical personnel involved in the course of treatment, nurses, physician's assistants, trained counselors, or patient educators.

C. Anesthesia services provided by or through Northside Anesthesiology Consultants may include:
1. Monitoring of vital signs and sedation
2. Nerve blocks (including spinal and epidural anesthesia)
3. General anesthesia
4. Placement of venous, arterial, or pulmonary artery catheters
5. Pain management, including epidural and patient-controlled anesthesia

D. I understand that anesthetic options during a procedure generally include Monitored Anesthesia Care (sedation), Nerve Blocks (with and without sedation), and General Anesthesia, and that the choice is guided by my general health and the planned procedure.

E. I understand partial awareness is likely for Monitored Anesthesia Care and Nerve Blocks and possible for General Anesthesia.

F. I further understand that acute post-operative pain management may involve (a) an epidural infusion of narcotics or a narcotic local anesthetic mixture or (b) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), a device for the controlled intravenous infusion of narcotics, and I consent to the use of those methods of pain management. Practical alternative methods of pain control may include the use of analgesic injections or pills. I understand that the method of post-operative pain management ultimately provided to me will depend upon my postoperative condition and the recommendations of my surgeon.

G. The material risks as a result of anesthesia related services are infection, allergic reaction, perforation, aspiration, cardiac dysrhythmia, injury to teeth or gums, visceral damage requiring surgical repair, severe loss of blood, paralysis or partial paralysis, paraplegia or quadriplegia, disfiguring scar, brain damage, cardiac arrest or death.

H. In addition to these risks, anesthesia services may involve risk of temporary or permanent loss or loss of function of any limb or organ system (such as, but not limited to, heart, kidneys, lungs, liver, eyes and brain), blood transfusion complications (including but not limited to exposure to the AIDS virus, hepatitis and other infectious diseases), and injury to or miscarriage of an unborn child.

Other risks related to specific anesthesia services include but are not limited to:
• Nerve blocks–injury to the nerve including persistent pain, loss of feeling or ability to move; reaction to anesthetic drug; headache and awareness of intraoperative events.
• General anesthesia–dental, eye, and nerve injury, pneumonia related to vomiting; reaction to anesthetic drug; awareness of intraoperative events.
• Monitored Anesthesia Care–injury to lung or blood vessels with loss of circulation and awareness of intraoperative events.
• Pain management–oversedation or breathing problems; infection; and nerve injury which may be temporary or permanent.
