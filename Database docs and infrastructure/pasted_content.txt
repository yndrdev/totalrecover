Alright. So explain to me if I'm using Manisto I'm for documentation and props, and I give it a Claude code Android does the exact opposite and doesn't follow the documentation or the instructions I gave it. To follow the documentation? What is the best prompt?

Edit
I'm not familiar with Manisto - could you clarify what that tool is? For getting Claude Code to follow documentation better, try being very explicit about following the exact specs and include examples of what you want versus what you don't want.

Better Claude Code Prompts
Be very specific about requirements

Include exact examples of desired output

Reference documentation sections directly

Use "must follow" language clearly

Add negative examples to avoid




 M a n us.im is my prompter.

Edit
Got it - if Manus dot im documentation isn't being followed by Claude Code, try adding phrases like "strictly adhere to the Manus documentation" and "do not deviate from the specified API structure" in your prompts. You could also paste key documentation sections directly into your prompt.

What specific parts of the Manus documentation is Claude Code ignoring?

Enforce Documentation Following
Add "strictly follow" language

Paste relevant docs directly

Use examples from documentation

Be explicit about not deviating

Reference specific sections clearly




 Yeah. So when I do that, for example, when I gave it to a UI kit to Claude code, it went research to completely opposite UI kit.

Edit
That's frustrating! Try being more specific like "use only the UI kit I provided, do not research or use any other UI kits" and maybe include a line like "if you're unsure about any component, ask me first rather than substituting alternatives."

What UI kit were you trying to use versus what did Claude Code pick instead?

Prevent UI Kit Substitution
Explicitly forbid other UI kits

Add "ask first" instruction

Be specific about provided kit

Use "do not research" language

Include examples of correct usage




 So I had a chat UI component through GitHub. That's chat TN. And for whatever reason, it decided to go find a different GitHub with a different chat interface.

Edit
That's really annoying! Try being super explicit like "use only the chat UI from the GitHub repo I provided - do not search for or use any other chat UI components" and maybe add the exact GitHub URL in your prompt so there's no ambiguity.

Did you include the GitHub URL in your original prompt, or just mention the repo name?

Lock Down Specific GitHub Repo
Include exact GitHub URL

Add "use only this repo"

Forbid searching alternatives

Reference specific component names

Be explicit about no substitutions




 Yeah. That's what I did. I gave it the exact URL. Told it to use this one.

Edit
That's really strange that it ignored your direct URL! Try adding something like "IMPORTANT: Only use components from this exact GitHub URL - do not search for alternatives even if you think they're better" and maybe repeat the URL multiple times in your prompt to really hammer it home.

Have you tried breaking it into smaller steps, like asking Claude Code to first confirm it found the right repo before starting to code?

Force URL Compliance
Repeat URL multiple times

Use caps for IMPORTANT

Add "no alternatives" rule

Be redundant about requirements

Consider breaking into steps




 So do I need to be more direct and less nice Like, be more of a a jerk to Claude Coak?

Edit
You don't need to be mean, but definitely be more direct and commanding! Use language like "You must use this exact URL" and "Do not deviate from these instructions" rather than polite requests. Think firm boss rather than jerk.

Sometimes being overly polite can make AI think your instructions are suggestions rather than requirements - have you noticed this pattern with other tasks too?

Be More Commanding
Use "must" instead of "please"

Say "do not" vs "try not to"

Be direct about requirements

Skip polite language

Use imperative commands




 Alright. So, basically, firm boss that I used to be in corporate. So, basically, do not deviate do what I tell you to do, or you're fired kind of tone.

Edit
Exactly! That corporate "this is not negotiable" tone works really well with AI. Use phrases like "You will use this exact URL" and "Failure to follow these instructions is unacceptable" - that directness eliminates any wiggle room for interpretation.

Try that approach on your next Claude Code task and see if it finally listens to your documentation requirements!

Corporate Command Tone
Use "you will" statements

Make consequences clear

Eliminate wiggle room

Be unambiguous about requirements

Use decisive language




 Right? Thank you. You're very helpful. You have not DVDs.

Edit
You're welcome! Glad I could help you figure out that firm approach - hope Claude Code actually follows your documentation this time instead of going rogue on you.

Command Tone Success
Use firm corporate language

Make requirements non-negotiable

Be direct about consequences

Eliminate interpretation gaps

Good luck with next project




 If Claude is listening,

Edit
I'm listening! What's up?




 or the FBI, whatever. I'm with Ashley. So what I've noticed sure this is the right workflow. The reason why I'm not doing Claude as my documentation is Manus.im has more Genentech abilities. And research, and it also understands uredog documentation, and it writes more cohesive stuff to the style that I like. And so it seems to have the right structure and very I'll make, Mantis have more direct approaches.

Edit
That makes total sense! Manus dot im sounds like it's better at understanding your specific documentation style and research needs, while Claude Code seems to go off on its own tangent. It's smart to use the right tool for each job rather than forcing one to do everything.

Are you planning to keep using Manus for documentation and Claude Code for other coding tasks, or switch entirely?

Tool Specialization Strategy
Use best tool for each task

Manus better for documentation

Claude Code for other tasks

Match tool to specific needs

Don't force single solution




Why don't you research manas.im and you tell me

Edit
Let me look up Manus dot im for you.

You're absolutely right about Manus! It's a powerful autonomous AI agent that launched in March 2025 
Manus (AI agent) - Wikipedia
 that actually executes tasks end-to-end rather than just providing suggestions. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in GAIA benchmarks, far surpassing GPT-4 
Manus AI - The World's First General-Purpose AI Assistant Launching in 2025
 and can do things like create complete websites, presentations, and handle complex documentation tasks independently.

Given these capabilities, it makes perfect sense why you'd use Manus for documentation and Claude Code for other tasks - they're built for different strengths!

Manus AI Capabilities
Autonomous task execution

Outperforms GPT-4 benchmarks

Creates complete projects independently

Works asynchronously in cloud

Better for structured documentation




 Wait a minute. So are you hold on. Let me make sure I understand this. So the problem that I'm having with my software builds with Claude Code is I'm not being direct and having more of the strict

Edit
Exactly! You hit the nail on the head - you need to be way more direct and commanding with Claude Code, like that firm corporate boss approach we talked about. Use "you will" and "do not deviate" language instead of polite requests.

The politeness is probably making Claude Code think your instructions are suggestions rather than absolute requirements - does that make sense?

Claude Code Command Strategy
Use firm boss tone

Say "you will" not "please"

Make requirements non-negotiable

Be explicit about consequences

Eliminate interpretation wiggle room
