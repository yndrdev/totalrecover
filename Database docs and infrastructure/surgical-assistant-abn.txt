SOUTHERN SURGICAL ASSISTANTS, LLC
ADVANCE BENEFICIARY NOTICE (ABN)

Your surgeon is requesting the services of Southern Surgical Assistants, LLC (SSA) for your upcoming surgery. Surgical Assistants ( Registered Nurse First Assist (RNFA), Nurse Practitioners (ARNP) and Physician Assistants (PA)) are commonly used for surgical procedures that are considered complex in nature and where an extra pair of skilled hands are necessary.

IF YOU HAVE MEDICARE, TRICARE, CHAMPUS, MEDICAID, ANTHEM BCBS, AETNA, CIGNA, EMPLOYER DIRECT, HUMANA OR UNITED HEALTHCARE

All surgical assistants with SSA are participating with the above listed payers therefore negotiated fees are accepted and your only financial liability (if any) will be your coinsurance and/or deductible. SSA will file for their services with your insurance and payment will be made directly to the provider. If there is a balance due you will be billed after all insurance payments have been received. No advance payment is required.

Medicare Supplemental policies pay for those expenses that are approved by Medicare but not paid by Medicare. Typically Medicare will forward their payment information to your Supplemental Insurance which frequently will pay the balance (depending on the type of coverage you have).

Secondary policies are "stand alone" plans. These policies have their own provisions for considering eligible expenses. These types of policies (often retirement programs) would be subject to the same guidelines as other commercial insurance payers and will often pay for the assistant's services.

ALL OTHER INSURANCE CARRIERS

Due to the limited availability of experienced first assistants within many healthcare networks in your area, It may be that the surgical assistant would be out of network with your insurance. SSA will file with your insurance but if the claim is denied or out of network penalties are applied SSA will contact you for authorization to appeal the claim. If the appeal is denied, SSA has an agreement with the surgeon that the patient liability will be limited to $300.

I have been notified by my physician/surgeon that (s)he is requesting the services of Southern Surgical Assistants (SSA) for my upcoming surgery.

I understand that if payment is denied I agree to be personally and fully responsible for payment of the services provided by my surgeon's designated first assistant but in no event more than $300.
