# üîç Let's Check Your GitHub Repository Structure

## Quick Check Steps:

### 1. Go to Your Repository
Visit: https://github.com/yndrdev/totalrecover

### 2. What Do You See?
Look at the file/folder list on the main page. Do you see:

**Option A - Individual Files:**
- README.md
- package.json
- app/ (folder)
- components/ (folder)
- lib/ (folder)
- etc.

**Option B - A Single or Few Folders:**
- Desktop/ (folder)
- Or other folder names

**Option C - Something Else:**
- Different files/folders
- Or empty repository

### 3. Click on Any Folders
If you see folders like "Desktop", click into them and navigate until you find where package.json is located.

### 4. Tell Me the Path
Once you find package.json, note the path. For example:
- If it's at: `Desktop/healthcare-platform/package.json`
- Then in Vercel, set Root Directory to: `Desktop/healthcare-platform`

## Common Scenarios:

### If You See "Desktop" Folder:
1. Click on "Desktop"
2. Click on "healthcare-platform" 
3. You should see package.json there
4. In Vercel, use: `Desktop/healthcare-platform` as Root Directory

### If You See "healthcare-platform" Folder:
1. Click on "healthcare-platform"
2. You should see package.json there
3. In Vercel, use: `healthcare-platform` as Root Directory

### If Repository Looks Empty or Wrong:
We may need to re-push the code correctly.
