# Feature 2: Patient Chat Interface (Main Feature)

## Overview

The Patient Chat Interface serves as the primary interaction point for the TJV Smart Recovery App, providing an intelligent, conversational experience that guides patients through their recovery journey. This feature combines modern chat UI design with AI-powered responses, voice-to-text capabilities, and seamless integration with tasks, forms, and educational content. The interface adapts to each patient's recovery phase, surgery type, and individual needs while maintaining a supportive and engaging user experience.

## Design Philosophy

The chat interface follows modern design principles inspired by leading conversational AI platforms, featuring a clean, card-based layout with the brand colors (#002238, #006DB1, #C8DBE9, #FFFFFF) and utilizing the shadcn/ui component library for consistency and accessibility. The design emphasizes clarity, ease of use, and emotional support throughout the recovery process.

## User Stories

### Epic: Conversational Recovery Experience

**As a Patient, I want to interact with my recovery program through a natural chat interface so that I feel supported and can easily access the help I need.**

#### User Story 2.1: Initial Chat Welcome and Onboarding
**As a Patient, I want to receive a personalized welcome message when I first access the chat so that I understand how to use the system and feel welcomed.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am a newly registered patient accessing the chat for the first time
- When I open the chat interface
- Then I should see a personalized welcome message using my first name
- And I should see an introduction to my recovery assistant
- And I should be presented with quick action buttons for common tasks
- And I should see my surgery information and recovery timeline
- And I should be able to ask questions or select from suggested topics
- And the system should explain how voice input works

**Technical Implementation:**
- Welcome message generation based on patient profile data
- Dynamic quick action buttons based on recovery phase
- Surgery-specific information display
- Voice input tutorial and permission request
- Onboarding progress tracking

**UI Components:**
```typescript
<ChatWelcome 
  patientName={patient.firstName}
  surgeryType={patient.surgeryType}
  surgeryDate={patient.surgeryDate}
  currentDay={patient.currentDay}
  onQuickAction={handleQuickAction}
  onVoiceSetup={handleVoiceSetup}
/>
```

#### User Story 2.2: Natural Language Interaction
**As a Patient, I want to ask questions in natural language and receive helpful, contextual responses so that I can get the information I need quickly.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am in the chat interface

- And the response should be tailored to my surgery type and recovery phase
- And the response should include actionable next steps when appropriate
- And the system should offer to connect me with my care team if needed
- And the conversation should feel natural and supportive

**Technical Implementation:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration with custom prompts
- Patient context injection (surgery type, day, previous interactions)
- Response time optimization with streaming
- Fallback to human escalation triggers
- Conversation memory and context retention

**AI Prompt Engineering:**
```typescript
const generateChatPrompt = (patient: Patient, message: string, context: ChatContext) => {
  return `You are a supportive recovery assistant for ${patient.firstName}, who had ${patient.surgeryType} surgery ${patient.currentDay} days ago. 
  
  Patient Context:
  - Surgery: ${patient.surgeryType} on ${patient.surgeryDate}
  - Current Day: ${patient.currentDay} (${getRecoveryPhase(patient.currentDay)})
  - Activity Level: ${patient.activityLevel}
  - Recent Pain Levels: ${context.recentPainLevels}
  - Completed Tasks Today: ${context.completedTasks}
  
  Guidelines:
  - Be encouraging and supportive
  - Provide specific, actionable advice
  - Reference their progress when appropriate
  - Suggest connecting with care team for medical concerns
