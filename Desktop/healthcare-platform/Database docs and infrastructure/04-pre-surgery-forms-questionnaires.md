# Feature 4: Pre-Surgery Forms and Questionnaires

## Overview

The Pre-Surgery Forms and Questionnaires feature provides a comprehensive digital intake system that streamlines the pre-operative process for both patients and healthcare providers. This feature transforms traditional paper-based medical forms into intelligent, interactive digital experiences that integrate seamlessly with the chat interface while ensuring complete HIPAA compliance and clinical accuracy. The system supports complex medical questionnaires, consent forms, clearance requirements, and risk assessments that adapt based on patient responses and surgery type.

## Design Philosophy

The pre-surgery form system prioritizes patient understanding and completion while maintaining clinical rigor and legal compliance. Forms are presented in a conversational, step-by-step manner that reduces anxiety and confusion often associated with medical paperwork. The system emphasizes clear explanations, visual aids, and voice input options to accommodate patients with varying literacy levels and physical limitations.
