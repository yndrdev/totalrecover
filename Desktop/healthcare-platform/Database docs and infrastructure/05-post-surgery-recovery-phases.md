# Feature 5: Post-Surgery Recovery Phases

## Overview

The Post-Surgery Recovery Phases feature provides a structured, adaptive, and personalized recovery journey for patients following total knee (TKA) or total hip (THA) arthroplasty. This feature delivers day-by-day guidance, tasks, and education based on evidence-based recovery protocols, while adapting to each patient's individual progress, pain levels, and functional milestones. The system is designed to support patients from the immediate post-operative period through long-term maintenance, ensuring they receive the right care at the right time.

## Design Philosophy

The recovery phase system is designed to feel like a personal recovery coach, providing encouragement, celebrating progress, and adjusting the plan based on patient feedback. The system uses a phased approach to recovery, with clear milestones and goals for each phase, helping patients understand their journey and stay motivated. The design emphasizes visual progress tracking, personalized content delivery, and seamless integration with the chat interface.
