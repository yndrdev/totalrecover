# Feature 7: Real-Time Nurse Intervention System

## Overview

The Real-Time Nurse Intervention System enables healthcare providers to monitor patient interactions and intervene immediately when patients report difficulties, pain, or complications during their recovery activities. This system maintains the seamless chat experience for patients while providing clinical staff with powerful tools to modify exercises, adjust protocols, and provide personalized guidance in real-time.

## Design Philosophy

This feature bridges the gap between automated recovery protocols and human clinical expertise. When patients encounter difficulties, the system immediately alerts appropriate clinical staff and provides tools for instant intervention without disrupting the patient's chat experience. The intervention appears as a natural part of the conversation, maintaining trust and continuity of care.

**CRITICAL: All nurse interventions happen within the Patient Detail Page on the clinic side. When a nurse selects a patient, they can monitor real-time activity and intervene immediately without leaving the patient's detail view. This maintains clinical focus and provides complete patient context during interventions.**
