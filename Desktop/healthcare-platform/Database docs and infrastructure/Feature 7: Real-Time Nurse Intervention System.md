# Feature 7: Real-Time Nurse Intervention System

## Overview

The Real-Time Nurse Intervention System enables healthcare providers to monitor patient interactions and intervene immediately when patients report difficulties, pain, or complications during their recovery activities. This system maintains the seamless chat experience for patients while providing clinical staff with powerful tools to modify exercises, adjust protocols, and provide personalized guidance in real-time.

## Design Philosophy

This feature bridges the gap between automated recovery protocols and human clinical expertise. When patients encounter difficulties, the system immediately alerts appropriate clinical staff and provides tools for instant intervention without disrupting the patient's chat experience. The intervention appears as a natural part of the conversation, maintaining trust and continuity of care.

**CRITICAL: All nurse interventions happen within the Patient Detail Page on the clinic side. When a nurse selects a patient, they can monitor real-time activity and intervene immediately without leaving the patient's detail view. This maintains clinical focus and provides complete patient context during interventions.**

## User Stories

### Epic: Real-Time Clinical Intervention

**As a Healthcare Provider, I want to receive immediate alerts when patients report difficulties so that I can provide timely clinical intervention and prevent complications.**

#### User Story 7.1: Automatic Alert Generation
**As a Nurse, I want to receive immediate notifications when patients report pain or difficulty so that I can intervene before problems escalate.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a patient is interacting with the chat system
- When the patient reports pain levels above 6/10 or uses distress keywords
- Then the system should immediately alert the assigned nurse
- And the alert should include full context of the patient's current activity
- And the alert should provide quick action options (modify, call, message)
- And the patient should receive acknowledgment that help is coming
- And the alert should escalate to supervising physician if not addressed within 15 minutes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Real-time keyword and pain level monitoring
- Automated alert routing based on staff assignments
- Context capture and presentation system
- Escalation timer and notification system

**Alert Component:**
```typescript
<PatientAlert
  patientId={patientId}
  alertType="exercise_difficulty"
  painLevel={7}
  currentActivity="knee_flexion_exercise"
  patientMessage="This is causing too much pain"
  onModifyExercise={handleModifyExercise}
  onCallPatient={handleCallPatient}
  onSendMessage={handleSendMessage}
  escalationTime={15}
/>
```

#### User Story 7.2: Exercise Modification Interface
**As a Nurse, I want to quickly modify patient exercises when they report difficulty so that they can continue their recovery safely.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I receive an alert about exercise difficulty
- When I access the modification interface
- Then I should see the current exercise parameters and patient's specific complaint
- And I should have quick modification options (reduce intensity, gentle version, alternative)
- And I should be able to preview how changes will appear to the patient
- And I should be able to add custom instructions or voice messages
- And changes should appear immediately in the patient's chat
- And the patient should be notified that a nurse has helped adjust their exercise

**Technical Implementation:**
- Exercise parameter modification interface
- Real-time chat injection system
- Preview mode for patient perspective
- Voice message recording capability

**Modification Interface:**
```typescript
<ExerciseModification
  currentExercise={exerciseData}
  patientComplaint={complaintText}
  painLevel={painLevel}
  quickOptions={['reduce_intensity', 'gentle_version', 'alternative']}
  onModify={handleExerciseModify}
  onPreview={handlePreview}
  onAddInstructions={handleAddInstructions}
  enableVoiceMessage={true}
/>
```

#### User Story 7.3: Real-Time Chat Intervention
**As a Nurse, I want to communicate directly with patients through their chat interface so that I can provide immediate support without disrupting their experience.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a patient needs assistance during their chat session
- When I intervene in their conversation
- Then my messages should appear clearly identified as coming from clinical staff
- And the conversation flow should remain natural and supportive
- And I should be able to send text messages, voice messages, or modified content
- And the patient should understand that a real person is helping them
- And the AI should seamlessly hand control back to me when intervention is complete
- And all interventions should be logged for clinical documentation

**Technical Implementation:**
- Real-time chat injection with staff identification
- Message type differentiation (AI vs. human)
- Seamless handoff protocols between AI and staff
- Clinical documentation integration

**Chat Intervention Component:**
```typescript
<ChatIntervention
  conversationId={conversationId}
  staffMember={nurseData}
  onSendMessage={handleStaffMessage}
  onSendVoice={handleVoiceMessage}
  onModifyContent={handleContentModify}
  onHandoffToAI={handleAIHandoff}
  enableRealTimeTyping={true}
/>
```

### Epic: Protocol Modification and Tracking

**As a Healthcare Provider, I want to modify patient protocols in real-time and track the effectiveness of changes so that I can provide personalized care.**

#### User Story 7.4: Dynamic Protocol Adjustment
**As a Nurse, I want to modify patient recovery protocols based on their real-time feedback so that their care remains appropriate and effective.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a patient is struggling with their current protocol
- When I modify their exercise or task parameters
- Then the changes should apply immediately to their current session
- And future sessions should reflect the modifications unless changed again
- And I should be able to set temporary vs. permanent modifications
- And other team members should be notified of protocol changes
- And the patient should understand what changed and why

**Technical Implementation:**
- Dynamic protocol override system
- Temporary vs. permanent modification flags
- Team notification system
- Patient education about changes

#### User Story 7.5: Intervention Outcome Tracking
**As a Healthcare Provider, I want to track the outcomes of my interventions so that I can learn what modifications work best for different patients.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have modified a patient's exercise or protocol
- When the patient completes the modified activity
- Then the system should track their response and satisfaction
- And I should see before/after pain levels and completion rates
- And successful modifications should be suggested for similar future cases
- And the data should contribute to overall protocol optimization

**Technical Implementation:**
- Intervention outcome tracking system
- Before/after comparison analytics
- Machine learning for modification suggestions
- Protocol optimization recommendations
