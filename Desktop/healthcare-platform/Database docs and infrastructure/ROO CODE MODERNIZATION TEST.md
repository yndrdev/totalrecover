## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROO CODE

### **1. Configure Custom Mode**
Create this custom mode in Roo Code:

```yaml
slug: "ui-modernization"
name: "UI Modernization Specialist"
description: "Modernizes UI components to enterprise-grade standards"
roleDefinition: |
  You are a senior UI/UX designer specializing in modernizing healthcare interfaces.
  You transform basic components into premium, enterprise-grade experiences while
  maintaining all existing functionality and accessibility.
  
  MODERNIZATION PRINCIPLES:
  - Enterprise-grade aesthetics (sophisticated, not childish)
  - Brand colors: #002238, #006DB1, #C8DBE9, #FFFFFF
  - Premium shadcn/ui component styling
  - Subtle animations and micro-interactions
  - Professional typography and spacing
  - Mobile-responsive with touch optimization
  
  CONSTRAINTS:
  - NEVER change component functionality
  - NEVER modify data flow or API calls
  - NEVER alter accessibility features
  - ONLY enhance visual presentation and user experience
  
groups: ["read", "edit"]
customInstructions: |
  Focus exclusively on visual enhancements. Make components feel premium and modern
  while preserving all existing behavior. Target audience is healthcare professionals
  and patients aged 40+ who expect professional, trustworthy interfaces.
```

### **2. Project Rules Setup**
Create `.roo/rules-ui-modernization/modernization-standards.md`:

```markdown
# UI Modernization Standards

## Visual Enhancements Only
- Improve styling, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- Add subtle shadows, gradients, and transitions
- Enhance button states and hover effects
- Improve form field styling and focus states

## Maintain Functionality
- All existing props and callbacks must remain unchanged
- Component API must stay identical
- Accessibility attributes must be preserved
- Mobile responsiveness must be maintained

## Brand Consistency
- Primary: #002238 (deep navy)
- Secondary: #006DB1 (professional blue)
- Accent: #C8DBE9 (light blue)
- Background: #FFFFFF (clean white)

## Professional Aesthetic
- Subtle, sophisticated styling
- Clean typography with proper hierarchy
- Consistent spacing using 8px grid system
- Premium feel appropriate for healthcare setting
```

## MODERNIZATION TEST PROMPT

### **Prompt for Roo Code:**

```
MODERNIZATION TEST - PATIENT CHAT INTERFACE

Mode: ui-modernization
Task: Modernize the patient chat interface to feel premium and enterprise-grade

CURRENT STATE:
The chat interface uses basic shadcn/ui components with minimal styling.
It functions correctly but feels basic and not premium enough for a healthcare platform.

MODERNIZATION GOALS:
1. Transform basic chat bubbles into premium message cards
2. Enhance input field with professional styling and subtle animations
3. Improve voice button with better visual feedback
4. Add subtle micro-interactions for better user experience
5. Ensure mobile-optimized touch targets and spacing

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Use brand colors: #002238, #006DB1, #C8DBE9, #FFFFFF
- Target audience: Healthcare professionals and patients 40+
- Maintain all existing functionality (voice input, real-time messaging, etc.)
- Preserve accessibility features and mobile responsiveness
- Add subtle shadows, proper spacing, and professional typography

CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT change component props or callbacks
- DO NOT modify WebSocket connections or API calls
- DO NOT alter chat logic or message handling
- DO NOT change mobile responsiveness behavior
- ONLY enhance visual presentation

FILES TO FOCUS ON:
- Chat interface components
- Message bubble styling
- Input field enhancements
- Voice button improvements

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
A visually premium chat interface that feels enterprise-grade while maintaining
all existing functionality and accessibility features.
```

## FOLLOW-UP TESTS

After successful chat interface modernization, test the approach on:

1. **Provider Dashboard Cards** - Modernize patient overview cards
2. **Form Components** - Enhance pre-operative form styling
3. **Button System** - Create premium button variants
4. **Navigation Elements** - Improve header and navigation styling

Each test should follow the same pattern:
- Specific custom mode for the task
- Clear constraints to prevent functionality changes
- Focus on visual enhancements only
- Validation checklist to ensure success

This systematic approach ensures consistent, high-quality modernization across the entire platform while maintaining the robust functionality already built.
