# STEP 2: STRICT FOLLOWING DIRECTIVE
## Complete Prompt for Roo Code

## ðŸ”’ AFTER DOCUMENTATION IS CREATED - USE THIS PROMPT

```
STRICT DOCUMENTATION FOLLOWING DIRECTIVE

Mode: healthcare-platform
Task: Implement strict adherence to project documentation

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE:
From this point forward, you MUST follow the project documentation exactly without deviation.

MANDATORY RULES:
1. **Read Documentation First**: Before any action, reference relevant docs/ files
2. **No Deviations**: Do not simplify, modify, or work around documented specifications
3. **Ask Before Changing**: If documentation seems unclear, ask for clarification
4. **Follow Constraints**: Respect all documented constraints and requirements
5. **Use Existing Schema**: Never modify or simplify the comprehensive database schema

DOCUMENTATION HIERARCHY:
1. docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - Overall project direction
2. docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md - Database structure (DO NOT MODIFY)
3. docs/UI_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md - Visual and interaction requirements
4. docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md - What you can and cannot do
5. docs/DEMO_USERS.md - Exact user specifications

WHEN IN DOUBT:
- Reference documentation
- Follow existing patterns
- Do not simplify or create workarounds
- Maintain professional healthcare standards

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- Simplifying database schema
- Creating "minimum field" versions
- Ignoring UI design standards
- Deviating from documented patterns
- Making assumptions without checking documentation

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:
- Always check docs/ before implementing features
- Use exact specifications from documentation
- Maintain professional healthcare appearance
- Follow brand colors and UI standards exactly
- Use comprehensive database schema as-is
- Create demo users exactly as specified

VALIDATION BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES:
âœ… Relevant documentation reviewed
âœ… Specifications understood and will be followed
âœ… No simplifications or workarounds planned
âœ… Professional healthcare standards maintained
âœ… Brand colors and UI standards applied
âœ… Database schema used without modification

This directive ensures consistent, professional development that meets healthcare platform requirements.

Every time you perform actions related to the project, append your actions to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you.

- âœ… No assumptions or guessing allowed
- âœ… Clear rules for what can and cannot be done
- âœ… Professional healthcare standards enforced

### **Creates Accountability:**
- âœ… Must check documentation before acting

## ðŸš€ IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

### **1. First run STEP 1 prompt** (Create documentation)
### **2. Then run this STEP 2 prompt** (Enforce strict following)
### **3. Continue with development** (All future work references docs)

---

## âœ… EXPECTED OUTCOME

After implementing this directive:
- Roo Code will always check documentation first
- No more schema simplification attempts
- Consistent professional healthcare UI
- Brand colors applied correctly
- Database schema used as-is
- Demo users created exactly as specified

**This creates the discipline needed for professional healthcare platform development!**
