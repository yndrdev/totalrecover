# TJV RECOVERY RESTART STRATEGY

## SITUATION ANALYSIS

Based on the Manus.im interface analysis and your feedback, we have critical issues that need systematic resolution:

### **üö® CURRENT PROBLEMS:**
1. **Inconsistent User Personas**: Claude Code and Roo Code built different demo users
2. **Missing Core Questions**: Pre-op and post-op chat questions are not implemented
3. **Non-Functional Builder**: Content management system is not easy or functional
4. **Broken Chat Flow**: Not following the conversational pattern shown in Manus.im

### **üéØ MANUS.IM INTERFACE INSIGHTS:**
From the replay, I can see the clean, professional interface with:
- Simple, focused conversation flow
- Clear task progression
- Professional documentation creation process
- Systematic approach to feature development
