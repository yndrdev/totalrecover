UI STYLING EMERGENCY FIX - MISSING CSS FRAMEWORK

Mode: healthcare-platform
Task: Fix completely unstyled login form - restore professional healthcare styling

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
The login form is displaying with plain HTML styling instead of professional healthcare interface. This indicates:
1. Tailwind CSS not compiling or loading
2. shadcn/ui components not properly installed/imported
3. CSS framework not configured correctly
4. Missing professional styling classes

IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:

1. **Verify Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
   Check tailwind.config.js has correct content paths:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
       './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
       './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
       './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {
         colors: {
           primary: '#002238',
           secondary: '#006DB1',
           accent: '#C8DBE9',
           background: '#FFFFFF'
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check globals.css imports:**
   Ensure app/globals.css contains:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

3. **Verify shadcn/ui Installation:**
   Run these commands if not already done:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add label
   ```

4. **Rebuild Login Page with Proper Components:**
   Replace the current unstyled login form with:
   - shadcn/ui Card component for container
   - shadcn/ui Input components for form fields
   - shadcn/ui Button component for submit
   - Professional healthcare styling classes
   - Proper responsive design

5. **Professional Healthcare Styling Requirements:**
   - Clean, modern card-based layout
   - Professional color scheme: #002238, #006DB1, #C8DBE9, #FFFFFF
   - Proper spacing and typography
   - Centered layout with appropriate padding
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Healthcare-appropriate styling for adults 40+

6. **Test CSS Loading:**
   Add temporary test classes to verify Tailwind is working:
   ```jsx
   <div className="bg-primary text-white p-4">
     Test - if this is styled, Tailwind is working
   </div>
   ```

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
âœ… Tailwind CSS compiling and loading correctly
âœ… shadcn/ui components installed and working
âœ… Login form uses Card, Input, Button components
âœ… Professional healthcare styling applied
âœ… Brand colors (#002238, #006DB1, #C8DBE9) visible
âœ… Mobile-responsive design working
âœ… Clean, modern healthcare interface (not plain HTML)
âœ… Proper spacing, typography, and layout
âœ… Form looks professional for healthcare setting

CRITICAL: The login form must look like a professional healthcare application, not a basic HTML form. Use shadcn/ui components with proper Tailwind classes to achieve this.
