ADVANCED CENTER FOR JOINT SURGERY
TOTAL JOINT DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Incision- Your incision will be closed with dissolvable sutures and covered with a waterproof bandage. Remove this bandage in 7 days. Purchase cotton gauze bandages and paper tape to cover the incision with if it is still bleeding. If an ace wrap is over your waterproof bandage remove it after 24 hours. Sometimes we have to use staples. If you have staples to close your incision they will need to be removed 14 days after surgery.

2. Showering- You are allowed to shower starting tomorrow. DO NOT submerge the incision in water until 4 weeks post-op (ie pool, hot tub, bath tub, ocean, or lake).

3. Driving- You may drive once you can walk without the aid of a walker and are off of narcotic pain medication. The time period before you can drive depends on recuperation speed and surgery performed.

4. Bruising and Swelling- Bruising and swelling after surgery is common and may be extensive. Treatment for this is ICE and elevation.

5. Use ice pack over incision area for 20-30 mins at a time as needed for pain/swelling.

Knee: The compression stocking and ice pack are given to you after surgery. Wear stocking on surgical leg during the day for 2 weeks. Remove it to shower. Ice and elevate for 30 minutes frequently throughout the day.

7. You may experience some lightheadedness after surgery especially with position changes. Please be careful when getting up and have your walker with you.

8. No dental cleanings for 3 months. No colonoscopy for 6 months. If planning a long car trip within 4 weeks of your surgery, do ankle pump exercises and get out of car every 2 hours to walk.

9. Flying- Non high risk patients may fly when comfortable enough to do so. High risk patients advised to wait longer (approx 4 weeks).

10. A small amount of bleeding is normal after surgery. However, if blood is leaking from your bandage please call 770-292-6500.

Refer to your personal medication record that was reviewed by your pre-op provider for when to resume home medications. A follow-up appointment should have been scheduled during your pre-op appointment. If you have any questions, please call the office.

The office number is 770-292-6500. If it is after hours you can reach an on call physician at this number.**
