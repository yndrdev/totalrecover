If accurate insurance information is provided, we will file a claim with your insurance company. The final bill may differ from this price estimate based on how the insurance company processes the claim.

I understand that the price listed above has been quoted to me for services rendered ACJS. By signing below, I have agreed to pay the patient responsibility amount prior to services being rendered.

ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS: I agree to assign any right I may have to receive payment from a health insurance plan or other payor(s) for services rendered by ACJS and the physicians caring for me during my treatment. I understand that I am financially responsible for all balances that are not covered by my health insurance plan or payor, as appropriate, based on the terms of contracts or the law. For example, the payment of non-covered services, deductibles and copayments are considered to be the patient's responsibility. I also understand that I am financially responsible for collection costs should my account become delinquent.

NOTICE REGARDING RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and as further explained in the Center's Notice of Privacy Practices, ACJS may use and disclose medical information to physicians or other providers for the purposes of providing treatment, and to payors for the purposes of payment for medical treatment. I acknowledge the receipt of a copy of the Center's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices.
