## ðŸš€ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **STEP 1: Create Documentation Structure**

```
CREATE COMPREHENSIVE DOCS FOLDER

Mode: healthcare-platform
Task: Create docs/ folder structure and copy all existing documentation

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Create docs/ folder structure:**
   ```
   docs/
   â”œâ”€â”€ features/
   â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/
   â”œâ”€â”€ implementation/
   â”œâ”€â”€ testing/
   â””â”€â”€ prompts/
   ```

2. **Copy all documentation files** from your existing project into appropriate folders:
   - Feature specifications â†’ docs/features/
   - Architecture docs â†’ docs/architecture/
   - Implementation guides â†’ docs/implementation/
   - Testing prompts â†’ docs/testing/
   - Complete prompts â†’ docs/prompts/

3. **Create PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** that references all documentation:
   ```markdown
   # TJV Recovery Platform - Project Overview
   
   ## Core Features
   - [Authentication](features/Feature-1-Authentication.md)
   - [Patient Chat Interface](features/Feature-2-Patient-Chat.md)
   - [Task/Form Builder](features/Feature-3-Task-Form-Builder.md)
   - [Pre-Surgery Forms](features/Feature-4-Pre-Surgery-Forms.md)
   - [Post-Surgery Recovery](features/Feature-5-Post-Surgery-Recovery.md)
   - [Exercise System](features/06-exercise-system.md)
   - [Nurse Intervention](features/07-nurse-intervention.md)
   - [AI Recovery Agent](features/08-ai-recovery-agent.md)
   
   ## Implementation
   - [Complete Prompts](prompts/Complete-Claude-Code-Prompts.md)
   - [Patient Interface Implementation](implementation/Patient-Interface-Complete.md)
   - [Nurse Workflow](implementation/Nurse-Exercise-Modification.md)
   
   ## Architecture
   - [Database Schema](architecture/database-schema.md)
   - [System Architecture](architecture/architecture.md)
   - [Wireframes](architecture/wireframes.md)
   ```

4. **Create activity.md** for logging:
   ```markdown
   # TJV Recovery Platform - Development Activity Log
   
   ## Project Setup
   - Fresh project created
   - Comprehensive documentation imported
   - Database schema implemented
   ```

VALIDATION:
âœ… All documentation files copied to docs/ folder
âœ… Proper folder structure created
âœ… PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md created with links
âœ… activity.md created for logging
âœ… Documentation accessible to Roo Code

Every time you perform actions related to the project, append your actions to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you.
```

## ðŸ”’ STEP 2: IMPLEMENT STRICT DOCUMENTATION DIRECTIVE

### **After Documentation is Copied:**

```
STRICT DOCUMENTATION FOLLOWING DIRECTIVE

Mode: healthcare-platform
Task: Implement strict adherence to comprehensive project documentation

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE:
You now have access to comprehensive project documentation in the docs/ folder. You MUST follow this documentation exactly without deviation.

MANDATORY RULES:
1. **Read Documentation First**: Before any action, reference relevant docs/ files
2. **Follow Specifications Exactly**: Use the detailed forms, exercises, and questions as specified
3. **No Simplifications**: Do not create "minimum" or "basic" versions
4. **Use Existing Database Schema**: Follow the comprehensive schema without modification
5. **Implement All Features**: Use the complete feature specifications

DOCUMENTATION HIERARCHY:
1. docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - Overall project direction
2. docs/features/ - Complete feature specifications with forms and exercises
3. docs/architecture/database-schema.md - Comprehensive database structure
4. docs/implementation/ - Detailed implementation guides
5. docs/prompts/ - Complete prompt sequences

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- **Pre-Surgery Forms**: Use exact questions from Feature 4 documentation
- **Post-Surgery Recovery**: Follow exact daily check-ins from Feature 5
- **Exercise System**: Implement video integration as specified in Feature 6
- **Nurse Intervention**: Real-time modification system from Feature 7
- **AI Recovery Agent**: Data flywheel system from Feature 8

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- Simplifying any documented specifications
- Creating "basic" versions of comprehensive features
- Ignoring detailed form questions and exercises
- Modifying the comprehensive database schema
- Skipping documented functionality

VALIDATION BEFORE ANY CODE:
âœ… Relevant documentation reviewed in docs/ folder
âœ… Exact specifications understood and will be followed
âœ… No simplifications planned
âœ… Comprehensive features will be implemented
âœ… Database schema will be used as documented

This ensures the complete TJV Recovery platform is built according to all specifications.
```

## âœ… BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH

### **Solves Current Problems:**
- âœ… **Stops Roo Code going off rails** - Clear documentation to follow
- âœ… **Implements all forms and exercises** - Exact specifications available
- âœ… **Maintains comprehensive features** - No more simplification attempts
- âœ… **Uses complete database schema** - No more "minimum field" versions
- âœ… **Professional healthcare standards** - All UI/UX guidelines documented

### **Provides Complete Specifications:**
- âœ… **Pre-operative questions** - Exact medical intake forms
- âœ… **Post-operative tracking** - Daily check-ins and recovery milestones
- âœ… **Exercise system** - Video integration and progress tracking
- âœ… **Nurse intervention** - Real-time modification workflows
- âœ… **AI recovery agent** - Data flywheel and learning system

### **Ensures Consistency:**
- âœ… **Single source of truth** - All specifications documented
- âœ… **Professional standards** - Healthcare-appropriate design
- âœ… **Complete functionality** - No missing features
- âœ… **Systematic implementation** - Step-by-step prompts available

---

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

### **1. Copy Documentation (30 minutes)**
- Create docs/ folder structure
- Copy all files from your existing project
- Organize into appropriate subfolders

### **2. Implement Documentation Directive (5 minutes)**
- Run the strict following directive
- Ensure Roo Code understands it must follow docs

### **3. Continue Development (Systematic)**
- Use existing prompts from docs/prompts/
- Follow feature specifications exactly
- Implement comprehensive functionality

---

## ðŸš€ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After implementing this strategy:
- âœ… Roo Code has complete project context
- âœ… All forms, exercises, and questions available
- âœ… Comprehensive features implemented correctly
- âœ… Professional healthcare platform delivered
- âœ… No more "going off the rails" issues

**This is the perfect solution - use your existing comprehensive documentation as the foundation for the new project!**
