2. I acknowledge and understand that during the course of the procedure(s) or treatment described in subparagraph (A)(l) above, conditions may develop which may reasonably necessitate an extension of the original procedure(s) or treatment or the performance of procedure(s) or treatment which are unforeseen or not known to be needed at the time this consent is obtained. I therefore consent to and authorize the persons described in the last paragraph of this consent to make the decisions concerning the performance of and to perform such procedure(s) or treatment as they may deem reasonably necessary or desirable in the exercise of their professional judgement, including those procedures or treatment that may be unforeseen or not known to be needed at the time this consent is obtained. This consent shall also extend to the treatment of all conditions which may arise during the course of such procedures or treatment and recuperation period including those conditions which may be unknown or unforeseen at the time this consent is obtained.

B. I acknowledge and understand and duly evidence in writing by executing this form that I have been informed in general terms of the following:
1. A diagnosis of the condition requiring the procedure(s) or treatment.
2. The nature and purpose of the procedure(s) or treatment, including the use of human or animal tissue and implants.
3. The material risks and benefits of the procedure and material risks and benefits of any practical alternatives, including recuperation periods and any potential radiation risks if the procedure involves x-ray.
4. The likelihood of success of the procedure(s) or treatment.
5. The prognosis if the procedure(s) or treatment described in (A)(1) is (are) rejected, and that such was provided through the use of videotapes, audiotapes, pamphlets, booklets, or other means of communication or through conversations with the responsible physician, or other medical personnel under the supervision and control of the responsible physician, other medical personnel involved in the course of treatment, nurses, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, trained counselors, or patient educators.

C. I acknowledge and understand that this request for and consent to surgical or diagnostic procedures or treatment shall be valid for the responsible physician, all medical personnel under the direct supervision and control of the responsible physician, and for all other medical personnel otherwise involved in the course of treatment.

D. I further consent to retention by the hospital or surgical center of any specimens of tissue removed from the patient's body during the proposed procedure(s) or treatment to be examined by pathologists, to be used for scientific or teaching purposes, and to be disposed of in the discretion of the hospital or surgical center and its medical staff.

E. The hospital or surgical center and the patient's physician have an educational role in the training of medical or paramedical personnel. I consent to the use of video or pictures during the proposed procedure(s) or treatment and the presence of such medical students or physicians observing and participating in the patient's care under supervision.

F. I have been informed that if the procedure involves the use of x-rays for imaging during the procedure this may result in a slightly elevated risk of cancer, hair loss, and/or skin damage.

G. I have also been informed if any physicians in training (residents or fellows) or any non-physician practitioners (physician assistants or nurse practitioners) may perform the procedure or any important task related to the procedure. I understand that any such participation will be in accordance with state law and hospital or surgical center policy.

I have been given ample opportunity to ask questions and any questions I have asked have been answered or explained in a satisfactory manner. By signing below, I acknowledge I have read or had this form read or explained to me and I understand it. I voluntarily consent to allow the physician(s) named above or any physician designated or selected by him or her and all medical personnel under the direct supervision and control of such physician and all other personnel who may otherwise be involved in performing such procedures or treatment to perform the procedures or treatment described or otherwise referred to herein.
