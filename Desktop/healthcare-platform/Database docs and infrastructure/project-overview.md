# TJV Smart Recovery App - Project Overview

## Vision Statement

The TJV Smart Recovery App revolutionizes orthopedic surgery recovery by providing a comprehensive, AI-powered digital health platform that guides patients through their entire joint replacement journey. Our vision is to transform the traditional, fragmented recovery experience into a seamless, personalized, and engaging process that improves patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs and provider burden.

The platform addresses the critical gap between surgery and full recovery by delivering timeline-based, personalized care through an intuitive chat interface that makes complex medical protocols accessible to patients of all technical skill levels. By integrating advanced AI capabilities, voice interaction, and smart device connectivity, we create a supportive digital companion that adapts to each patient's unique needs and progress.

## Problem Statement

Current orthopedic surgery recovery faces several critical challenges that our platform directly addresses:

**Patient Challenges:**
- Overwhelming amount of pre-surgery preparation with complex forms and requirements
- Lack of clear, day-by-day guidance during the critical recovery period
- Difficulty tracking progress and understanding what constitutes normal recovery
- Limited communication channels with healthcare providers between appointments
- Inconsistent exercise compliance due to lack of motivation and guidance
- Anxiety and uncertainty about recovery milestones and expectations

**Healthcare Provider Challenges:**
- Time-intensive patient education and monitoring requirements
- Difficulty tracking patient compliance and progress between visits
- Limited resources for personalized patient support
- Inefficient communication systems leading to unnecessary office visits
- Challenges in identifying patients at risk for complications or poor outcomes
- Administrative burden of managing multiple patients across different recovery stages

**System-Level Challenges:**
- High healthcare costs associated with complications and extended recovery times
- Inconsistent care delivery across different providers and practices
- Limited data collection for outcome improvement and research
- Lack of integration between different aspects of care (exercise, education, monitoring)

## Core User Flows

### 1. Patient Onboarding and Pre-Surgery Journey

**Timeline**: 30-45 days before surgery

The patient journey begins when they are scheduled for surgery and enrolled in the TJV Recovery program. The onboarding process is designed to be welcoming and non-intimidating, recognizing that many patients may be anxious about both their upcoming surgery and using new technology.

Upon enrollment, patients receive welcome communications that introduce them to the platform and set expectations for their recovery journey. The system automatically calculates their surgery date and begins delivering pre-surgery content and tasks according to a personalized timeline.

The pre-surgery period focuses on preparation, education, and optimization. Patients complete comprehensive medical questionnaires through the chat interface, making the process feel conversational rather than clinical. The system intelligently branches based on responses, providing relevant educational content and triggering necessary medical clearances.

Exercise protocols during this period focus on pre-operative conditioning, with the system providing video demonstrations and tracking compliance. Educational content covers surgery preparation, what to expect, and home preparation requirements.

### 2. Immediate Post-Surgery Recovery Journey

**Timeline**: Day 0-7 after surgery

The immediate post-surgery period represents the most critical time for patient engagement and support. The system transitions from preparation mode to active recovery support, with frequent check-ins and carefully structured activities.

Patients receive hourly reminders for basic exercises like ankle pumps and walking sessions. The chat interface provides encouragement and tracks completion of each activity. Pain assessment occurs multiple times daily, with the system learning patterns and providing insights to both patients and providers.

The system carefully monitors activity levels to prevent both under-activity and overexertion. Step count limits are enforced with gentle reminders, while range of motion exercises are introduced gradually with video guidance and progress tracking.

Communication with healthcare providers is streamlined through the platform, with automatic alerts for concerning symptoms or lack of progress. Patients can easily report issues or ask questions through the chat interface, with AI providing immediate support and escalating to human providers when necessary.

### 3. Progressive Recovery Journey

**Timeline**: Day 8-84 after surgery

The progressive recovery period focuses on gradual return to function and independence. The system adapts exercise protocols based on individual progress, increasing complexity and intensity as patients demonstrate readiness.

Functional milestones become the focus, with the system celebrating achievements and providing motivation for continued progress. Range of motion assessments become more sophisticated, with patients learning to measure and track their own progress.

The transition from assistive devices (walker to cane to independent walking) is carefully guided with safety protocols and progression criteria. The system provides confidence-building exercises and fall prevention strategies.

Return to activities of daily living is systematically addressed, with specific protocols for driving, work, and recreational activities. The system provides personalized timelines based on individual progress and occupation-specific requirements.

### 4. Healthcare Provider Workflow

Healthcare providers access a comprehensive dashboard that prioritizes patients needing attention. The interface is designed for efficiency, allowing providers to quickly assess multiple patients and identify those requiring intervention.

Patient detail views provide complete recovery timelines with exercise compliance, pain trends, and communication history. Providers can easily adjust protocols, send messages, and document clinical decisions.

The system supports collaborative care with role-based access allowing surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists to contribute their expertise while maintaining clear communication and avoiding duplication of effort.

Analytics and reporting tools help providers track outcomes, identify best practices, and demonstrate value to administrators and payers.
