## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOLS

### **If Implementation is Incomplete:**
```
The previous response was incomplete. DO NOT BE LAZY. Provide the complete implementation including all code, styling, and integration details. This is critical healthcare software - incomplete implementations could impact patient care.

Complete the implementation by providing:
- Full component code with TypeScript types
- Complete CSS/Tailwind styling
- Database integration functions
- Error handling and loading states
- Integration with existing systems

Rate your confidence (1-10) on the completeness of your response. If below 10, continue with the missing pieces.

- Look like enterprise medical software (never consumer-app styling)
- Maintain HIPAA compliance and patient data protection
- Support clinical workflows for surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists
- Use professional healthcare colors and typography
- Include comprehensive error handling for patient safety
</healthcare_context_reinforcement>
```
