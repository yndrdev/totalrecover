# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide - Fixed Schema

## The Error You Got
The SQL script failed because your Supabase database was missing some required columns. I've fixed this!

## 3-Step Fix

### Step 1: Fix Schema + Create Demo Data
**In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:**
1. Copy and paste **ALL** content from: `scripts/fix-schema-and-create-demo.sql` 
2. Click **RUN**
3. You should see: "Schema fixed and demo accounts created successfully!"

### Step 2: Create Auth Users  
**In your terminal:**
```bash
cd /Users/yndr/Desktop/healthcare-platform
node scripts/create-supabase-auth-users.js
```
You should see: "🎉 Demo user creation complete!"

### Step 3: Test Login
**Start the app:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Go to:** http://localhost:3000/login

**Test with:**
- **Email:** `sarah.johnson@tjvdemo.com`
- **Password:** `DemoPass123!`
- **Then go to:** http://localhost:3000/chat

## What I Fixed

### 🔧 Database Schema Issues
- ✅ Added missing `subdomain` column to `tenants` table
- ✅ Added missing `user_id` column to `profiles` table  
- ✅ Added missing `full_name` column to `profiles` table
- ✅ Created `patients`, `conversations`, `messages` tables if missing
- ✅ Fixed all foreign key relationships

### 🔐 Authentication Issues  
- ✅ Login form now looks for profiles by `user_id` instead of `id`
- ✅ Fixed routing after login (patient → `/chat`, provider → `/provider`)
- ✅ Auto-creates profile if missing during login
- ✅ Signup form creates proper profile records
- ✅ Demo login buttons work correctly

### 🎨 UI/Navigation Fixes
- ✅ Fixed signup/login page links
- ✅ Proper redirects after registration
- ✅ Error handling for missing profiles

## What You'll See After Setup

### 👤 Patient Login (`sarah.johnson@tjvdemo.com`)
- ✅ Redirects to `/chat` automatically
- ✅ Shows Day 4 recovery interface matching your screenshot
- ✅ Dark sidebar with care team, missed tasks, etc.
- ✅ Real conversation data loaded

### 👨‍⚕️ Provider Login (`dr.smith@tjvdemo.com`) 
- ✅ Redirects to `/provider` dashboard
- ✅ Can monitor Sarah Johnson's progress
- ✅ Access to all provider tools

### 🏥 Admin Login (`admin@tjvdemo.com`)
- ✅ Redirects to `/admin` dashboard  
- ✅ Full system administration access

## Troubleshooting

### If Step 1 fails:
- Make sure you have `tenants` and `profiles` tables in Supabase
- Try running just the `ALTER TABLE` commands first

### If Step 2 fails:
- Check your `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials
- Make sure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set (not just the anon key)

### If login doesn't work:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the user was created in Supabase Auth dashboard
- Make sure profile record exists in `profiles` table

That should fix everything! The error was just missing database columns. 🎉
