# üö® CRITICAL FIX - Package.json Not Found

## The Problem
Your GitHub repository has the wrong directory structure. The files were pushed inside a subdirectory instead of the root.

## Immediate Fix - Two Options

### Option 1: Fix in Vercel UI (Quickest)
1. Go back to your Vercel import page
2. In the **"Root Directory"** field, enter: `Desktop/healthcare-platform`
3. Click outside the field to confirm
4. Deploy again

### Option 2: Check Your GitHub Repository Structure

1. Go to: https://github.com/yndrdev/totalrecover
2. Check if you see:
   - ‚ùå A folder called "Desktop" at the root
   - ‚úÖ Or files like package.json, app/, components/ at the root

If you see a "Desktop" folder, your files are nested incorrectly.

## If Files Are Nested (Desktop folder visible):

### In Vercel:
Set **Root Directory** to: `Desktop/healthcare-platform`

### Or Fix the Repository:
We need to restructure the repository to have files at the root level.

## Quick Check
Visit: https://github.com/yndrdev/totalrecover/blob/main/package.json

If this gives a 404 error, then visit:
https://github.com/yndrdev/totalrecover/blob/main/Desktop/healthcare-platform/package.json

The second link working confirms the nested structure issue.
