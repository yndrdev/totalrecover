# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIX - Vercel API Route Error

## The Problem
Vercel is looking for API routes in the wrong location. Your routes are in `app/api/` (App Router) but the config is wrong.

## Fix It Now - Delete vercel.json

### Fastest Solution: DELETE vercel.json completely

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/yndrdev/totalrecover/blob/main/vercel.json
2. **Click the trash can icon** (Delete this file)
3. **Commit message**: "Remove vercel.json - use default settings"
4. **Click "Commit changes"**

### Why This Works
- Vercel auto-detects Next.js and App Router
- The maxDuration settings aren't critical for initial deployment
- You can add them back later if needed

## Alternative: Update vercel.json (if you want to keep it)

Replace the entire content with just:
```json
{}
```

Or for App Router compatibility:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/chat/ai-response/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    },
    "app/api/chat/ai-response-stream/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

## After Fixing
- Vercel will automatically redeploy
- Your app will work with default settings
- You can optimize later

**Just DELETE the file - it's the quickest fix!**
