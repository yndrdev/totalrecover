# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIX - Vercel Deployment Error

## The Problem
Your `vercel.json` file on GitHub has a `rootDirectory` property that Vercel doesn't accept.

## Fix It Right Now (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to your file on GitHub
Click this link: https://github.com/yndrdev/totalrecover/blob/main/vercel.json

### Step 2: Click the pencil icon (Edit)

### Step 3: Replace EVERYTHING in the file with:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/chat/ai-response/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    },
    "app/api/chat/ai-response-stream/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
- Add commit message: "Fix vercel.json - remove rootDirectory"
- Select "Commit directly to the main branch"
- Click "Commit changes"

### Step 5: Go back to Vercel
Your deployment should automatically restart with the fixed configuration.

## Alternative: Delete the file
If the above doesn't work, just DELETE the vercel.json file entirely:
1. Go to https://github.com/yndrdev/totalrecover/blob/main/vercel.json
2. Click the trash can icon
3. Commit the deletion
4. Vercel will use default settings (which is fine)

**That's it! This will fix your deployment immediately.**
