# Roo Code Documentation Directive - IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION

## üö® **CRITICAL: STOP ALL CURRENT WORK AND READ THIS**

This directive must be given to Roo Code immediately to prevent further schema simplification and ensure proper documentation compliance.

## üìã **COPY THIS ENTIRE PROMPT TO ROO CODE:**

```
MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION COMPLIANCE DIRECTIVE

Mode: healthcare-platform
Task: Implement strict documentation adherence for TJV Recovery Platform

CRITICAL STOP ORDER:
- STOP all schema simplification attempts immediately
- STOP creating "basic" or "minimum" versions of anything
- STOP working around documented specifications
- STOP making assumptions about requirements

MANDATORY READING REQUIREMENT:
Before writing ANY code, you MUST read and understand these documentation files:

1. docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - Mission, users, core principles
2. docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md - Mandatory compliance rules
3. docs/features/ - All feature specifications with acceptance criteria
4. docs/database/ - Comprehensive schema (DO NOT MODIFY)
5. docs/wireframes/ - UI/UX specifications
6. docs/workflows/ - Clinical workflows and processes

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:

1. DATABASE SCHEMA COMPLIANCE:
   - Use the comprehensive schema EXACTLY as documented
   - DO NOT simplify table structures
   - DO NOT create "basic" versions
   - Follow multi-tenant architecture with RLS policies
   - Use existing relationships: auth.users ‚Üí profiles ‚Üí patients

2. UI/UX STANDARDS:
   - Professional healthcare design for adults 40+
   - Brand colors: #002238, #006DB1, #C8DBE9, #FFFFFF
   - shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - NO childish or educational styling

3. CHAT INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS:
   - AI speaks first (conversational-form approach)
   - Direct questions: "Do you smoke? Yes or No"
   - No "Are you ready?" prompts
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Voice input integration with OpenAI Whisper

4. NURSE INTERVENTION SYSTEM:
   - All interventions within Patient Detail Page
   - Real-time monitoring and alerts
   - Exercise modification without page navigation
   - Professional clinical workflow

5. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE:
   - HIPAA compliance throughout
   - Multi-tenant isolation
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Secure authentication and authorization

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
‚ùå Simplifying database schema
‚ùå Creating "basic" versions of features
‚ùå Ignoring documented specifications
‚ùå Using different UI components than specified
‚ùå Modifying comprehensive table structures
‚ùå Deviating from professional healthcare design

VERIFICATION PROCESS:
Before implementing any feature:
1. Read the relevant documentation completely
2. Understand all acceptance criteria
3. Confirm approach aligns with specifications
4. Implement exactly as documented
5. Test against all acceptance criteria

ESCALATION PROTOCOL:
If documentation seems unclear or conflicting:
1. Ask for clarification before proceeding
2. Do NOT make assumptions
3. Do NOT work around the issue
4. Do NOT simplify the requirement

COMPLIANCE CONFIRMATION:
Respond with "DOCUMENTATION COMPLIANCE CONFIRMED" and list the 5 key files you will read before proceeding with any development work.

This directive is non-negotiable and must be followed exactly.
```

## üéØ **EXPECTED ROO CODE RESPONSE:**

Roo Code should respond with:
```
DOCUMENTATION COMPLIANCE CONFIRMED

I will read these 5 key files before any development:
1. docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md  
3. docs/features/ (all feature specifications)
4. docs/database/ (comprehensive schema)
5. docs/wireframes/ (UI/UX specifications)

I understand I must:
- Use existing comprehensive schema without modification
- Follow professional healthcare design standards
- Implement AI-first conversational chat interface
- Build nurse intervention within Patient Detail Page
- Maintain HIPAA compliance and multi-tenant security

I will not simplify, modify, or work around any documented specifications.
```

## üîß **FOLLOW-UP VERIFICATION PROMPT:**

After Roo Code confirms compliance, use this verification prompt:

```
DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION TEST

Task: Demonstrate understanding of key requirements

Please confirm your understanding by answering these questions:

1. What is the correct database relationship chain for users?
   (Answer should be: auth.users ‚Üí profiles ‚Üí patients)

2. What are the 4 brand colors for the platform?
   (Answer should be: #002238, #006DB1, #C8DBE9, #FFFFFF)

3. How should the chat interface behave for pre-operative forms?
   (Answer should be: AI speaks first, direct questions like "Do you smoke? Yes or No")

4. Where do nurse interventions happen in the UI?
   (Answer should be: Within the Patient Detail Page)

5. What is forbidden regarding the database schema?
   (Answer should be: Simplifying, modifying, or creating basic versions)

Only proceed with development after confirming all 5 answers are correct.
```

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

### **Roo Code is Back on Track When:**
- Stops trying to simplify schema
- References documentation before making decisions
- Asks for clarification instead of assuming
- Follows professional healthcare design standards
- Implements features exactly as specified

### **Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Any mention of "simplifying" or "basic versions"
- Creating new table structures
- Ignoring documented UI specifications
- Working around instead of following requirements
- Making assumptions about unclear requirements

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:**

1. **Copy documentation directive** to Roo Code immediately
2. **Wait for compliance confirmation** before proceeding
3. **Run verification test** to ensure understanding
4. **Continue with systematic development** following documented prompts
5. **Monitor for compliance** throughout development process

This directive will get Roo Code back on track and prevent further deviations from your comprehensive specifications!
