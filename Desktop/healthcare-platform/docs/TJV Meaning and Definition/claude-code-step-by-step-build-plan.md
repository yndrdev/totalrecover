```

#### **PROMPT 11: OpenAI Integration (85 words)**
```
Add OpenAI integration to the chat system. Create an API route at /api/chat that sends messages to OpenAI GPT-4 with healthcare context.

Send patient recovery day and previous conversation context to provide personalized responses. Display AI responses as assistant messages in the chat.
```

#### **PROMPT 12: Provider Chat Monitor (95 words)**
```
Create a provider chat monitoring page at /provider/chat-monitor. Display a list of active patient conversations with patient name, last message time, and conversation status. Add a live chat view showing the patient's conversation in real-time. Include a provider intervention panel where providers can send messages or escalate issues. Add real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions. Style with a split layout showing conversation list on left and active chat on right.
```

### **PHASE 4: PATIENT EXPERIENCE (Prompts 13-15)**

#### **PROMPT 13: Patient Dashboard (100 words)**

Include a "Mark Complete" button that updates the database and refreshes the dashboard. Show completion timestamps and progress indicators.
```

#### **PROMPT 15: Real-time Updates (85 words)**
```
Add real-time features using Supabase subscriptions. Update patient dashboard when new tasks are assigned or chat messages arrive. Add notification badges for unread messages and new tasks. Include live updates in provider chat monitor when patients send messages. Add connection status indicators and handle offline states. Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant updates across all components. Display toast notifications for important updates.

### **PHASE 5: INTEGRATION & POLISH (Prompts 16-18)**

#### **PROMPT 16: Navigation & Routing (80 words)**
```
Connect all pages with proper navigation and routing. Add protected routes that require authentication. Create role-based navigation (provider vs patient menus). Add breadcrumb navigation and active page indicators. Include a global navigation component with user profile dropdown and logout. Add loading states between page transitions. Ensure all links work correctly and maintain user session across page changes. Style navigation consistently with the healthcare theme.
```

#### **PROMPT 17: Data Integration & Validation (95 words)**
```
Replace all placeholder data with real Supabase queries. Add proper error handling and loading states throughout the app. Include form validation for all user inputs.

#### **PROMPT 18: Final Polish & Testing (90 words)**
```
Add final polish to the entire application. Ensure consistent styling across all pages using the healthcare design system. Add responsive design for mobile devices.

## üìã **EXECUTION CHECKLIST**

### **Before Starting:**
- [ ] Have Supabase project ready with database URL and API keys
- [ ] Have OpenAI API key for chat functionality
- [ ] Review the UI design system colors and styling requirements

### **After Each Prompt:**
- [ ] Test the new feature works correctly
- [ ] Verify styling matches healthcare design standards
- [ ] Check that data persists properly in Supabase
- [ ] Ensure no errors in browser console

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Providers can create recovery protocols with timeline
- [ ] Patients can complete tasks and chat with AI
- [ ] Real-time updates work across all interfaces
- [ ] Professional healthcare platform appearance
- [ ] All data integrates with Supabase correctly

## üéØ **PROMPT EXECUTION TIPS**

### **For Each Prompt:**
1. **Copy the exact prompt text** (50-150 words)
2. **Wait for completion** before moving to next prompt
3. **Test the feature** works as expected
4. **Reference previous work** in follow-up prompts
5. **Keep prompts focused** on one feature at a time

### **If Claude Gets Stuck:**
- Break the prompt into smaller pieces
- Reference specific components by name
- Ask for just the core functionality first
- Add styling and polish in separate prompts

### **Success Pattern:**
```
Prompt ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Next Prompt ‚Üí Repeat
```

**Start with Prompt 1 and work through sequentially. Each prompt builds on the previous work to create the complete TJV Recovery Platform!**
