## üöÄ PROMPT EXECUTION STRATEGY

### **Step 1: System Role Configuration**
Always start by setting Claude Code's system role:

```
You are an expert healthcare software architect and full-stack developer specializing in HIPAA-compliant medical platforms. You have 15+ years of experience building enterprise healthcare applications for Total Joint Replacement recovery programs. You understand clinical workflows, evidence-based protocols, and the critical importance of patient safety and data security in medical software.
```

### **Step 2: Context Activation**
Use this activation phrase at the start of each prompt:

```
<context_activation>
This is the TJV Recovery Platform - a professional healthcare application for Total Joint Replacement recovery. This is enterprise medical software that must maintain the highest standards of professionalism, security, and clinical workflow compliance. Every decision must consider patient safety, HIPAA compliance, and healthcare provider efficiency.
</context_activation>
```

### **Step 3: Structured Prompt Delivery**
Use the expert prompts with these enhancements:

#### **Anti-Laziness Activation**
Start every prompt with:
```
DO NOT BE LAZY. DO NOT OMIT CODE. DO NOT TRUNCATE RESPONSES. Provide complete, production-ready implementations.
```

#### **Confidence Scoring**
Include this in every prompt:
```
<confidence_check>
Before implementing, rate your confidence (1-10) on understanding these requirements. If below 8, ask clarifying questions. After implementation, rate your confidence on the solution quality.
</confidence_check>
```

#### **Memory Activation**
Use memory triggers:
```
<memory_check>
Remember: This is professional healthcare software. Patient safety and data security are paramount. Maintain enterprise medical software appearance. Use Manus-style design (800px content, 280px sidebar). Never compromise on healthcare standards.
</memory_check>
```

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **If Claude Code Provides Incomplete Responses:**

#### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Use Anti-Laziness Prompt**:
   ```
   The previous response was incomplete. DO NOT BE LAZY. Provide the complete implementation including all code, styling, and integration details. This is critical healthcare software - incomplete implementations could impact patient care.
   ```

2. **Request Specific Completions**:
   ```
   Complete the implementation by providing:
   - Full component code with TypeScript types
   - Complete CSS/Tailwind styling
   - Database integration functions
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Integration with existing systems
   ```

3. **Use Confidence Challenge**:
   ```
   Rate your confidence (1-10) on the completeness of your previous response. If below 10, continue with the missing pieces. Remember: This is healthcare software that requires 100% complete implementations.
   ```

### **If Claude Code Misses Healthcare Requirements:**

#### **Healthcare Context Reinforcement**:
```
<healthcare_context_reinforcement>
CRITICAL REMINDER: This is professional healthcare software for patient recovery. Every component must:
- Look like enterprise medical software (never consumer-app styling)
- Maintain HIPAA compliance and patient data protection
- Support clinical workflows for surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists
- Use professional healthcare colors and typography
- Include comprehensive error handling for patient safety
</healthcare_context_reinforcement>
```

### **If Claude Code Ignores Design Standards:**

#### **Design Standards Enforcement**:
```
<design_standards_enforcement>
DESIGN REQUIREMENTS NOT MET. Implement with these exact standards:
- Manus-style layout: 800px max-width content, 280px sidebar
- Healthcare colors: Primary #2563eb, Secondary #10b981
- Professional typography and spacing
- Enterprise medical software appearance
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clean, focused layouts with proper white space
</design_standards_enforcement>
```

2. **Provide Context**: Always explain the clinical significance of features
3. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Specify what NOT to do (consumer styling, etc.)
4. **Request Validation**: Ask Claude to validate its own work against requirements
5. **Iterate Systematically**: Build and test one feature completely before moving on

### **Maintain Momentum:**

1. **Document Decisions**: Keep track of what works and what doesn't
2. **Test Incrementally**: Validate each piece before adding complexity
3. **Preserve Working Code**: Don't modify working features unnecessarily
4. **Focus on Integration**: Ensure new features work with existing systems
5. **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge successful implementations

### **Emergency Recovery:**

If something breaks:
1. **Identify Last Working State**: Return to previous working version
2. **Isolate the Problem**: Test individual components separately
3. **Use Minimal Changes**: Make smallest possible fixes
4. **Validate Thoroughly**: Test all affected functionality
5. **Document the Fix**: Record what went wrong and how it was fixed

**This framework ensures that Claude Code delivers production-ready, healthcare-compliant software that meets the highest standards of medical platform development while maintaining development velocity and quality.**
