## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS

**DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
- **Next.js/React**: Modern React patterns with proper state management
- **Supabase Integration**: Real-time subscriptions, RLS policies, audit logging
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- **Testing**: Test with real Supabase data across all user roles

**FEATURE MODULARITY:**
- All features must be **modular and configurable** through JSON configuration files
- Each feature must have its own directory under `/features/` with config.json
- All UI elements (colors, dimensions, text) must be configurable
- All behavior (API settings, thresholds, toggles) must be configurable
- Features must be toggleable (enable/disable) without breaking the app

**DATABASE OPERATIONS:**
- Use **read-only mode** when possible to prevent accidental data modification
- Always validate user permissions before data access
- Implement proper **multi-tenant data isolation**
- Add **audit logging** for all sensitive data operations
- Never modify existing schemas without explicit instruction

## üìã DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:**
1. **Read existing documentation** in /docs/ directory thoroughly
2. **Rate your confidence** (1-10) on understanding the requirements
3. **List all assumptions** and ask clarifying questions if needed
4. **Check existing code patterns** and maintain consistency

**WHEN IMPLEMENTING FEATURES:**
1. **Follow modular architecture** with proper feature directory structure
2. **Create configuration files** for all customizable aspects
3. **Use established UI patterns** and design system components
4. **Test with real data** across all user roles and scenarios
5. **Document all changes** and update relevant documentation

**QUALITY ASSURANCE:**
- Test all authentication flows and role-based access control
- Verify multi-tenant data isolation works correctly
- Ensure professional healthcare appearance is maintained
- Validate real-time features and Supabase subscriptions
- Test responsive design across multiple screen sizes

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**EVERY CHANGE MUST:**

## üéØ ACTIVATION CHECKLIST

After using this prompt, verify Cline understands by asking:

1. **"What type of platform are we building and what are the critical requirements?"**
2. **"What UI standards should I follow for the chat interface?"**
3. **"How should I handle database operations and patient data?"**
4. **"What's the proper workflow for adding new features?"**
5. **"What are the absolute protection rules I must never violate?"**

**If Cline demonstrates understanding of healthcare requirements, Manus-style design, database protection, and feature modularity, you're ready to proceed with development!**
